# Tutorial no 1
In this Tutorial we will make basic codes for bot and we will host Bot 24hr for free!

# Requirements

2. Npm v7
3. A code editor / online code editor (replit, glitch)
4. Terminal
```
# Checking Things/Stuffs
Before starting the project we have to first check our versions.
<br />
Let's check node version.(Remember that discord.js v13 uses node v16 and will not work if you have node v12 or lower than 16)
<br  />

# Checking Node version
If you are using private code editor like vscode, then follow the step;
```
1. Open your terminal 
2. Type "node -v" (remember you must have installed node v16)
```
If it shows `node v16.something`, then you have your node version updated to node v16!
<br />
If not then follow the steps ;
```
1. Delete your previously installed node(If you haven't installed before then skip)
2. Open Chrome and type 'node.js'.
3. Go to the official site of node.js and install the latest version
```

Now if you are using online code editor like replit.com, then follow the steps to check version;

```
1. Open shell 
2. Type node-v
```
If it shows node v12, then your repl not updated to node v16.
<br />
